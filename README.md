Files for BiS332 Bio-Information Processing (team-based)
The task was to implement an emulation of a future healthcare system, and it included 2 sub-tasks:
Phase 1: design of a database system connecting disease, SNP, and gene data.
Phase 2: implementation of the designed database (from phase 1) and querying system (querying system was handled by me, and is provided in this repo). The presentation for phase 2 is provided [here.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFibAHgbqk/qbOyz6N6XzUoV5qTcRYPrA/view)
Phase 3: design and implementation of a biomedical database system on a chosen topic. Our team implemented a pharmacokinetics database, which provided pharmacokinetics data for a patient (on top of the disease data) from SNP and gene data. The querying system (handled by me) outputs a readable PDF report that includes affected drugs and susceptible diseases based on genetic data. An example report is provided [here](https://github.com/tulga-rdn/bis332/blob/main/BiS332_creative_exreport.pdf) and the presentation for this phase is provided [here.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFi3wfBElI/Q1UV7V7JH9UaQDXckbPglA/view)
